Gazebo vs Ignition:

The Gazebo that we all know from before is not going to be supported anymore
The another simulation software called ignition has been in development for a long time in parallel with gazebo 
Now the ignition got popular and it is more advance than classic gazebo, The Open source robotics foundation is renaming  the ignition software as gazebo
and dropping the development of classical gazebo

From Gazebo Garden both Gazebo and ignition are same
